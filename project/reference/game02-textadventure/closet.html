      <h1>What's in that glowing closet?</h1>
      <p>Your curiosity gets the best of you and you journey through the narrow corridor towards the glowing closet.</p>
      <p>As you approach the closet, you see the source of the light immediately: a TV set has been left on, with the final credits of a movie still on the screen.</p>
      <p>On the table next to the TV you see the DVD case - it looks like some kind of documentary. Seems interesting, and you're tempted to watch it...</p>
