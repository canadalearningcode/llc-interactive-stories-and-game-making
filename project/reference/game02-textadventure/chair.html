      <h1>What's that smell?</h1>
      <p>You work up the guts to investigate the funky smelling chair. The smell gets stronger as you get closer...</p>
      <p>Plugging your nose and expecting the worst, you spin the chair around and are shocked to see the source of the smell is... old running shoes. *Phew*</p>
      <p>"How can someone let their shoes get so smelly?!" you asked outloud to yourself.</p>
      <p>Beside the running shoes you also see a lunchbox, a bag of gym clothes, and a set of keys.</p>
