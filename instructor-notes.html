      ###Instructor Notes

      ###Ladies Learning Code: Interactive Stories and Game Making with HTML & CSS

      <br>
      ##Schedule

      <strong> Important note:</strong>
      This is a guideline, not a rule! It is more important that the learners are following along then it is to get to the end of the slides!

      <em>Please note</em>: this schedule is for a single day workshop.
      If you are leading two weekday evenings, you can split this schedule up accordingly. Please remember to take a 15-30 minute break on both days. The first 15-20 minutes of the second day should be allocated for review and questions from the prior session.

      * <strong>Intro (10:00 am - 11:00 am)</strong>: Why Game making, brainstorm
      * <strong>Intro to HTML (11:00 am - 12:30 am)</strong>: Coding environment and intro to HTML 
      * <strong>Lunch Break! (12:30 pm - 1:00 pm)</strong>
      * <strong>CSS (1:00 pm - 3:30 pm)</strong>: Intro to CSS, Game jam time, bonus exercise
      * <strong>Wrapping it up (3:30 pm - 4:00 pm)</strong>


      <br>
      ##General Notes

      * <strong>Important!</strong> Please give learners enough time to download learner files. Check in as people are entering the room to make sure they have learner files.
      * A common issue with leaner files - make sure Windows users extract the folder. If a learner sees the slides without any styles, that is probably why.
      
      Before the class starts, update the WiFi credentials on slide 1.

      If possible, have some paper, pens or pencils ready for the brainstorming part of this workshop.


      <br>
      ##Specific Examples

      **Slide 6: Theme of the month**

      We have a rotating theme of the month that will be highlighted on this slide. The learners can take some time to brainstorm how they relate to this theme - it could be from first-hand experience, a cultural connection, a systemic issue or barrier they face, etc. Learners are making the connection right on the outset that the technologies they're about to learn can be used to solve real life problems. If you have the time while preparing before the workshop, bookmark some examples of cool sites that surround the theme of the month and show them during this time to help the learners get inspired.


      **Slide 8: IMPACT OF DIGITAL GAMING**

      Human have been telling stories to grapple with the human experience for as long as we have existed. Gaming is just another medium to tell your story. When women aren't telling their stories, less women and girls will be able to hear their stories. This is all about elevating the voices of those often unheard and marginalized in society.


      **Slide 13: Project Brainstorm**

      This may be the hardest part of the class, depending on how imaginative you are! Break out the paper and pencils, or use whatever medium you prefer to come up with the outline for your quiz, adventure or action game. Where do options exist? What are the possible outcomes from each option?

      Reference this example. Notice that decisions are drawn as rhombuses (diamonds), and outcomes are rectangles.
      https://i.pinimg.com/originals/25/3c/13/253c134b9fc826999ad0e86b648ee207.png
      Arrows don't always have to be labeled yes or no. You can ask 'which door?' and have doors 1, 2 and 3 as your possible outcomes.


      **Slide 15: WEB BROWSERS**

      Ever browser will render a web page SLIGHTLY differently. It's part of a developer's job to correct for this and make sure the experience is the same across all browsers. Today we're all going to use the same browser to make things easy.


      **Slide 16: DEVELOPER TOOLS**

      Using the Developer Tools can be really intimidating for beginners, so allocate a suitable amount of time to explore the developer tools based on the experience level of the group. Show how you can select an HTML element to see which styles are applied, hide some of the styles, or change some of the values. Show them at least twice how to open and then close the developer tools.


      **Slide 21: HTML SYNTAX**

      Take the time to point out these characters on the keyboard. They are not used often by average users, and take some time to form the muscle memory. Someone who can usually type blog posts or word documents without looking at the keyboard may have to look down more frequently today, and that is perfectly okay!


      **Slide 23: Nested Tags**

      Compare this to layering two sweaters - the order in which they close matters! You have to zip up your inner sweater before you can zip up the outer sweater - if you try to cross the zippers up, it won't work!
      

      **Slide 24: ORGANIZING YOUR CODE**

      Indentation is ESSENTIAL, especially for beginners, to better exercise the pattern recognition parts of their brains. It makes debugging your code 100x easier. REALLY emphasize and encourage good habits early on. When you're doing a code along, tell them out loud when it's important to indent, and when it is more of a personal preference (eg. text within an `<a>` tag)


      **Slide 26: SETTING UP YOUR PROJECT**

      Take the time to walk through this, a couple times if necessary. Some people out of habit will just go to File > Open instead of Add Project Folder. It's much easier to look at the project as a whole instead of many Text Editor windows with separate files.


      **Slide 29: THE DOCTYPE**

      You can briefly mention that they may see older Doctypes on the web, but we are moving away from those older versions.


      **Slide 28: THE HEAD ELEMENT**

      People can SEE your body, but they cannot see what is going on inside your head. What's going on inside your head is integral to making your body function, but you have to take a peak "under the hood" (viewsource) in order to see what elements are in the `head`.


      **Slide 34: ATTRIBUTES**

      In case you get asked, UTF-8 is the most popular character code. It covers European (latin based) languages, Greek, Kurdish, and Iranian languages. If you're website is in Mandarin, Cantonese or Japanese, you will need to use a different character code (UTF-8 only covers 86-88% of the characters in those languages).

      To explain attributes in general, you can show them a fake tag to represent your coffee order:

      ```
      <coffee style="latte" milk="almond" sweetener="honey">Laura</coffee>
      ```


      **Slide 41: THE DEBATE ABOUT HEADINGS & HTML5 SECTIONING TAGS**

      It is a hotly contested issue in SEO & web dev industries if you should be allowed to use more than one `h1` per page. People have very strong feelings one way or another. Here you can elaborate on your personal experience and opinion. Ask the mentors to jump in as well and share their ideas. The learners are leaning on your collective expertise to help them make a decision on what to do.


      **Slide 42: SELF-CLOSING TAGS AND IMAGES**

      No closing tag is needed because the image has all the information it needs by way of attributes.


      **Slide 44: Image file paths**

      This is a difficult concept for beginners to wrap their heads around, so don't rush while explaining this one. Use your hands to point at the side pane on the left in the text editor. Note the indentations and how they demonstrate the relationship between files and folders.


      **Slide 56: HYPERLINKS**

      Avoid using words like "click here" in a link. Use something more descriptive, like "get in touch with us" or "take a tour". This is good practice for accessibility and gives the user a clear idea of what a link will do without having to read all the surrounding text for context.

      **Slide 47: EXERCISE #4: ADD LINKS AND IMAGES (15MINS)**

      If they have some extra time, see if they can challenge themselves by hyperlinking an image! Hint - use nested tags!


      **Slide 49: CSS: THE PRESENTATION LAYER**

      In the early days of the web, style, layout and format was not a concern. The purpose of the web was to share research papers, documents and raw information. Presentation through CSS was not introduced until 6 years later. You can show them the first website ever made (feel free to read the intro paragraph out loud to the class):
      http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html

      Same as we did with the HTML syntax slide - take the time to point out these uncommon characters on the keyboard.


      **Slide 50: CSS SYNTAX & TERMINOLOGY**

      You can use the coffee order analogy again to explain how properties are applied to a selector. The barista is looking for YOU, as the selector. Then they gather the properties that you want in your beverage order:

      ```
      laura{
         order: cold-brew;
         milk: soya;
         flavour: vanilla;
      }
      ```


      **Slide 51: MULTIPLE CSS DECLARATIONS**

      Remind learners that NONE of us have all the properties memorized. It's a good idea to bookmark some frequently used resources (found at the bottom of this slide), or walk them through how to do a Google search for a property, like 'change font size with CSS' or 'change colour of text with CSS'.


      **Slide 59: CSS FONT STYLES**

      Note out loud that `color` needs to spelled the American way. It's a common hiccup for beginners.


      **Slide 60: WEB SAFE FONTS**

      In this case, Mac computers have the font Helvetica by default. If you're using a Windows computer, you won't have that font unless you purchased and installed it, so the browser will then use Arial instead.
      If for some reason your machine doesn't have Arial installed, it would just use some sans-serif font.


      **Slide 61: CLASS EXERCISE: HOW TO USE GOOGLE FONTS**

      Show them what happens when you select many fonts and the effect it has on the loading time. Think of each font as a rock you're adding to your backpack when going on a hike. The heavier the backpack, the slower you're going to be walking. A website works the same way! Keeping things lightweight and only including the resources you need makes the site perform faster.


      **Slide 62: INHERITANCE AND SPECIFICITY**

      Why is the `h1` more specific? Because it is a **child** of the body. Child elements are always more specific than their ancestors.


      **Slide 64: CLASS EXERCISE #5: TYPOGRAPHY (CONTINUED)**

      A common mistake is to use the syntax or descendant selectors when you meant to combine selectors, or vice versa. Commas are used when you are listing items in a sentence: "I need to buy bread, apples, bananas etc."


      **Slide 65: BLOCK AND INLINE ELEMENTS**

      This slide is a doozy - we're introducing the display property and box model properties at the same time! For now just let them experiment with changing values and observing the results. We'll dive into margin and padding in more detail very soon.


      **Slide 66: BLOCK AND INLINE ELEMENTS**

      Notice that changing the margin will only apply to the left and right, not the top or bottom! This is how an inline element behaves.


      **Slide 67: MARGIN AND PADDING**

      Imagine you're packaging a fragile object for shipping. The `padding` is like the bubble wrap or packing peanuts that go inside the box to protect the object. The border is like the edge of the box. The margin is the distance between the box and whatever is around it.


      **Slide 68: MARGIN AND PADDING**

      Encourage people to use the long form for today if it is easier to understand. Alternatively, use comments to remember which value represents which side.


      **Slide 69: PRACTICE!**

      Allocate about 10-15 minutes to practice. Then get them to apply margin or padding or both to some part of their project. We're about to get into more specific selectors soon, so let's get the hang of using these properties first before we switch gears.


      **Slide 71: BEING MORE SPECIFIC - USING A CLASS**

      A `class` is like a tape label on a ziploc container in your fridge. It helps you identify one container from another without having to look inside. Just like the tape label, the `class` name should be specific and describe its contents. `class1` and `class2` aren't very descriptive. You wouldn't have `cousin1` and `cousin2` in your contact list, right?
      A `class` can be applied to **any** element inside the `body`, or even to the `body` itself!


      **Slide 72: DESCENDANT SELECTORS**

      It can help to either read this from right to left, or where you see a space, imagine saying "and then...". Each space looks one level deeper. 


      **Slide 75: PSEUDO CLASS & HOVER EFFECTS**

      Think of this slide as a bonus - if they are feeling overwhelmed at this point, they can skip pseudo classes.


      **Slide 78: GAME JAM TIME!**

      Do this together:<br>
      1. Create a new HTML page<br>
      2. Copy the contents of `index.html` and paste it into the new file you created. Make one change to this page so you can differentiate the 2 - for example, change the `title` and/or the `h1` tag content.<br>
      3. Create a link on `index.html` to link to the new page.<br>
      4. Test it out in the browser and see if it works


      Now ask them to repeat these steps for all the necessary pages. They can refer back to the plan they created at the beginning of the class to map out how many HTML pages they'll need to create, and where links will be placed.

      It can help to think of the links as doorways or portals that allow you to move from one page to another. Where will the doors open and which rooms will they lead us to?


      **Slide 79: BONUS EXERCISE**

      Your call if you want to proceed from here. If you have  around an hour or more, go for it! If you have 30 minutes or less, wrap things up. It's more important to leave on a positive note than to rush to get to the end. It can leave the learners with a feeling of anxiety if they're rushing to copy & paste and not really absorb what they're doing. They can also try this from home or come to a free drop-in day to get help from mentors! Ask your chapter lead when the next drop-in day is scheduled for.




      **Slide 80: SOME MORE ADVANCED CSS**

      Open the example link and play the game so they have a visual of what they are working towards.


      **Slide 85: INPUTS: RADIO BUTTONS**

      Think of a radio dial - you can only tune into one channel at a time. This name actually comes physical buttons used on car radios to select preset stations – when one of the buttons was pushed in, other buttons would pop out.


      **Slide 91: CSS ANIMATIONS**

      "And we want the overall speed of our animation to be the same throughout (linear)"
      If we used a different property other than linear, the targets may move quickly, and then slowly, and then quickly again.


      **Slide 83: Today...**

      Now is the time to acknowledge and congratulate the learners - they should feel proud for taking the time to learn something new, push themselves out of their comfort zone and challenge themselves. This workshop covered A LOT of material, so feeling overwhelmed is totally expected and normal! Don't forget to acknowledge and thank the mentors at this time too!


      **Slide 95: NEXT STEPS!**

      Get them excited about where they can go from here, whether that be through more workshops with us, independent learning, or where they can find local meet-up groups or events, online or in person.
